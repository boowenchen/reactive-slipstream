# Local implementation review

Self-review using correctness, security, architecture, readability and performance
checks; this is not an independent external audit.

Trust boundaries: user configuration → immutable contract parameters; authenticated
network LogRecord → reactive state; proxy plus injected sender → destination action;
fixed test-token calls → asset accounting; public RPC responses → benchmark evidence.
Ownership, origin contract/chain/topic filters, policy epochs or pool sequence numbers,
callback replay, input caps, atomic rollback and fee/principal separation were reviewed.
Bounded subscriptions avoid unbounded constructor loops. Contracts compile under
the EVM size limits. This review was written before deployment; it involved no private keys, account creation or transaction submission.

Resolved during implementation: one-shot test impersonation consumed by getters;
stack depth in scripts (via-IR); stale library/API example mismatch; dependency ws
advisory (updated viem); constant-size alternating benchmark swaps erasing their own
spread (target-price input solver); feedback loops; terminal cron billing; and unsafe
activation of an already released vault.

Foundry lint notes are not all clean: timestamps are deliberate time-policy inputs;
subscription loops are fixed length; reserve casts follow explicit uint112 bounds;
pool transfer callbacks are protected by a lock and the supported tokens have no hooks.
External-token/reentrant-token behavior is outside the declared fixture scope.
No lint suppression was used to claim a clean security audit.

Gates closed after this review (evidence in README.md): real subscriptions and
authenticated signer delivery, actual fee budgets and testnet transaction evidence, benchmark
success rate and timing, and chart visual inspection.
Still open: upstream dependency licensing (see SOURCES.md) and independent review. Retryable
destination actions still depend on funded network execution. Remote activity cannot
veto a destination transaction that is already executing.
